Hello 2019! I'd like to wish you all a very happy new year and hope that this year brings you nothing but good health, lots of 
happiness and lots of love! Whatever 2018 may have been, it's time to start fresh, embrace the new you and open up your new
outlook in life for 2019.

I will be doing the same. It's a new year so it's a new me. We learn and experience different things and situations year after
year that make us who we are as a person. For me, I am starting to learn how to embrace my new-found self. I don't know why it 
takes us humans years to find ourselves but it's a great feeling when you do. I have definitely found a piece of me, a huge piece
of me. I'm starting to embrace the different facets of my life that make me who I am and am truly honing in on what I love in life,
what I don't and what I need to modify or improve. 

It's been quite the trip leading up to this. Many questions, fears, deaths and other factors pushed me to find what I really love to do. 
As my life progressed, I exercised many ideas, schemes and rackets and tried out different careers and really tried to find what a 
career or life was supposed to be. Well in the end, my wife, whom I owe it all to, asked me one question and forced me to answer it: 
"What do you love to do?"

I've known the answer to this my whole life but was always scared to fully immerse myself in the idea because really, we've got
bills to pay and I had many nights of crippling fears of self-doubt. I'm also not from a wealthy family and wasn't properly taught how 
to manage money growing up so money managed me. I wasn't taught early on how to invest my time and money to provide me financial freedom 
in the future. Mix that all in with failed starts and attempts, minimal success, and the beginning of a new family and it's like
the perfect storm of "Fuck this career and go get a job to work the rest of your life" mentality and it starts to consume you, day by day.
But, I finally muttered the answer to myself and believed it. Music is what I want to do and is the only thing I want to do. When she heard 
it, she believed it too. Now, I fully believe it and know exactly that music is what I have to do, in some form of capacity, until the day
I can't. 

I'm lucky to have the musical talents I have and I want to share my talents to the world so that I can bring value to people's
lives by being the soundtrack to their lives, through me or through you.

So, this year, I plan on releasing songs to start on my new journey. These songs will be fully written and performed by me, something 
that I have never really done before. I've always worked with people throughout the years but this time around, It's all me. I worked
out all the feelings, melodies, arrangements, mental blocks and fears and have come out with a few songs that I can really call my own.
I'm lucky enough to have music as my way of communicating with the world and although it took me along time to fully realize this, I 
realize it now and my little heart couldn't be anymore happier. I have also written a few songs on the side not for release but more for 
other opportunities and licensing purposes.

So, what else do I have under wraps for 2019? Aside from being focused on writing, recording and releasing music, I'm also going down
a few different paths to see where new opportunities may lead me either mentally, musically and financially. My interests are currently
being currently piqued by music (d'oh!), real estate, financial investments, ecommerce, entrepreneurship and all things that could enrich my life
even more at this time. Needless to say, I'm excited for this year!

Here's to 2019. Let the new us begin!
