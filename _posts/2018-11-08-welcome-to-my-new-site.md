The joy oozing out of me is completely unhinged. I recently took a chance in porting over my personal site to Github and after
a few learning curves, numerous chats with hosting/domains providers and friends chiming in, I've finally gotten 
a good grasp of the whole operation and am totally onboard. You must understand that I started from scratch by the way, since
Git works a different way from the previous site generators I've worked with in the past. More joy just oozed out after I wrote
that as I thought about the last few weeks.

So, here we are.

I've got a new site and I'm super thrilled to start sharing anything and everything I can to bring value to people's lives. 
Whether it's advice for guitarists, life hacks, uplifting photos, inspirational ideas, visual reverence, trends, interviews 
or anything to do with lifestyle, I'm in it. I want to bring the value and enrich people's lives as much as I can.

If you have no clue who I am, my name is Gian. I have a huge background in music and live, breathe and devour music on the daily. I've done tours, mini-tours, sessions, fill-ins, subs, wrote songs for others, consulted and owned my very own music magazine called Frantik Mag, that did quite well during it's time. I've also played and was involved in a slew of semi-successful bands throughout the years including My Private Hell, Overdose, Signal 3, Between Enemies, Reckless Audio and HotRod. I've also worked with countless musicians, companies and freelanced throughout the years that helped me sharpen my teeth and get me to where I am now. It's been one hell of a ride and I've got many stories to tell.

Aside from all the music in my life, I'm also an immigrant that emigrated to the U.S. in 89.' I also sharpened my teeth in the streets and acquired a different fabric to add to mine after all of my experiences, good or bad. But with all of those experiences, music remained the constant and helped me through a lot of hard times. Because of this, I've stuck to my guns, stayed loyal and consider music my saving grace.

I'd love to give you more details by the way of what the site will actually focus on but I can't. That's only because, this time, I'm making it personal, which is something I have never done before. It's always been about someone or something else. Now that I'm older and wiser though, I believe it's time to tell my stories, share my experiences and again, bring value to people's lives by being transparent, honest, truthful and never losing sight of what makes life joyous, happy and substantial, all with a musical flair.

Let the journey begin.
