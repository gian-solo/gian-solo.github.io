Do you have any clue how loud your guitar squeaks are?

Probably not. If you're like me, I was not aware how bad the strings squeaked until the very first time I recorded myself. I took
out the Tascam 4-track (yup, I'm older than you thought), fired it up, plugged in all necessary cables, pointed the mic on my amp,
pressed record and played the song. After that very first take, I couldn't listen to it. I didn't want to for fear that I sucked or
really was too excited to press playback. But that only took an hour. I pressed playback, enjoyed the hell out of it and then proceeded
to do more takes cause really, my ambitious musician ass really had some big rockstar dreams, as most of you do.
