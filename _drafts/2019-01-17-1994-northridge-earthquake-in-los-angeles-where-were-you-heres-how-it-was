25 years ago, today, Los Angeles, mainly the San Fernando Valley, was awakened in a brutal manner by a devastating earthquake.

At the end of the shaking, which lasted for 1-3 days, 50 people were killed, the damage ended up costing $35 billion and left 22,000 people displaced
from their homes. Because of the cost in damage, it is simply one of the most expensive natural disasters to ever occur on this
planet and is currently the costliest earthquake in U.S. history. Los Angeles simply looked like a war zone at the end of it with
toppled buildings, no power and deaths across the Southland. 

Now, scientists are warning that there is indeed, a big one waiting in the wings. Their estimates are eye-popping at an estimated 
270,000 people displaced and a whopping 1,800 dead if an 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck Los Angeles. The 94' quake was a strong
6.7 magnitude. Imagine that!
