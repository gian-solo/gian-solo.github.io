25 years ago, today, Los Angeles, mainly the San Fernando Valley, was awakened in a brutal manner by a devastating earthquake.

At the end of the shaking, which lasted for 1-3 days, 50 people were killed, the damage ended up costing $35 billion and left 22,000 people displaced
from their homes. Because of the cost in damage, it is simply one of the most expensive natural disasters to ever occur on this
planet and is currently the costliest earthquake in U.S. history. Los Angeles simply looked like a war zone at the end of it with
toppled buildings, no power and deaths across the Southland. 

Now, scientists are warning that there is indeed, a big one waiting in the wings. Their research produces an eye-popping estimate of 
270,000 people displaced and a whopping 1,800 dead if an 8.0 magnitude earthquake struck Los Angeles. The 94' quake was a strong
6.7 magnitude. Imagine that!

My account of things starts with karaoke.

My friends and I, a bunch of us actually, ended up at a friend's house in Sylmar after we left a raging party that was going down 
in Hollywood. My friends owned a huge house in Sylmar and offered extended fun with karaoke and home-cooked food from his mom, whom
he woke up to actually cook for us. We couldn't resist so we headed over.

All was fine and dandy, until it wasn't.

We were partied out. After eating the home-cooked food, we were all about to wind it down and actually head home. So I decided to do 
one more karaoke song before heading out. In the middle of the song, I started to hear and feel a low rumble that was getting louder 
by the second. Upon looking out the window, I noticed lights turning off on the block and then....

BOOM!!!
