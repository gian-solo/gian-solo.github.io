When I was learning how to master the guitar, there was a lot of exploring and figuring out going on. I didn't have the Internet
so fetching for info was simply not as easy as it is today with just a few clicks. The best part is, the same wisdom that I gathered
from musicians, magazines, tv and wherever else, is the same wisdom that is being passed on to the young guitarists of today.

Some of that wisdom are hacks.

Guitar hacks arose from the needs of guitarists. Back in the day, instead of searching for an answer, people invented their own 
"hacks" to accomplish what it was they were trying to get out of the guitar. Refined many years later, these guitar hacks are now 
widely used in popular music.

These 10 hacks that I provide for you come from my back pocket. Sure others may already know these hacks or have tried them but I 
guarantee that there is 1-3 that you've not ever read, heard or done before. It comes from my expertise and experience as a live 
performer and studio musician. Again, I've done these myself!
