At the start of 2018, I started to wonder about Frantik Magazine. At first, it was nostalgia, looking through old videos, articles, interviews, live reviews, cd reviews and all that was covered. I saved the hard files before deleting the existence of Frantikmag.com, not really knowing if I needed them or would ever really look through them, but I did.
Many people wondered why I shuttered my very own creation and the answer is simple: frustration. I was frustrated at the fact that I had taken everything on, which caused me to burnt out much faster than I ever thought I would. Now don't get me wrong, it was a success, but my frustrations somehow started to really fuck with me, mentally, over time. 

The team I had unfortunately didn't come across the frustrations I had as I literally took everything on and did everything to make sure whatever needed to get done, was going to get done without fail. Many of my frustrations built up from there, all to my own fault because I couldn't trust anyone else to run the company. 

After many years, I've finally come into a crossroad in my life and after thinking about it over and over again, I decided that this may be the right time to get back to the swing of things. It will be a bit different this time around as the model has changed and I'd be able to flex other muscles instead of regurgitating what I had done with Frantik. Needless to say, muscles will be flexed and this time, I'll be able to handle much better by working smarter, not harder.

I'm still in the planning process. But even now, I can feel my creative juices flowing, my brain humming and my intentions ultra clear. Making light of things that went wrong and owning up to it has given me a whole new look at what I could creatively offer and how I can bring the value to what I offer. I'm definitely focused, determined and gearing up to get back in the game.

I'm excited!

I haven't been excited for a project in a long time. I'm taking it all in for now and breathing life into the project but its getting closer to really becoming real. The impact may not be the same this time around but I've got super high hopes that this journey will be much more substantial in all its aspects from amazing content, finance and lasting impressions. The one thing I'm sure of though...is that people will appreciate the value that my new venture will bring and I cannot wait for people to join the venture and find a new hub that they can call home.

It's totally happening.
