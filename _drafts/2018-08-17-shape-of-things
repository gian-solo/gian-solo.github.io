excerpt: "Gian is busy at work. With a number of projects all happening around the same time frame, getting back into the swing of things is going to take some hard work. But Gian is not dettered. In fact, he's laser focused, determined and newly-inspired to finish the creation of his new vision and he cannot wait to share what he's got in store."

At the start of 2018, I started to wonder about Frantik Magazine. At first, it was nostalgia, looking through old articles, interviews, live reviews, cd reviews, frantik girls and all that was covered. You're probably wondering how as Frantikmag.com is nowhere to be found online. Well kids, I saved the hard files before deleting the existence of Frantikmag.com</p>
Many people wondered why I shuttered my very own creation and the answer is simple: frustration. I was frustrated at the way Frantik was going, seeming to stay stagnant in over a year, even though operations and everything else was ramped up for success. Now don't get me wrong, it was a success, but my frustrations somehow never left me and I started to take the same frustration home every night and it really started to fuck me up, mentally.
