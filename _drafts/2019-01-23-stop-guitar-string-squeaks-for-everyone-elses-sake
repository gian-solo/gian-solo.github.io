Do you have any clue how loud your guitar squeaks are? Do you even know what I'm talking about? If you do, do you know how to stop guitar squeaks?

Probably not. If you're like me, I was not aware how bad the strings squeaked when I played until the very first time I recorded myself. I took
out the Tascam 4-track (yup, I'm older than you thought), fired it up, plugged in all necessary cables, pointed the mic on my amp,
pressed record and began laying down the track. After that very first take, I pressed playback, enjoyed the hell out of it and then proceeded
to do more takes cause really, my ambitious musician self really had some big rockstar dreams, as most of you do. A day later, I listened to it again 
and after only a few minutes, I finally heard it. The recordings were marred by guitar squeaks, left and right, every single time I
finger strummed the acoustic guitar parts. It drove me mad.

I tried mixing something to no avail. I was a newbie to playing guitar and recording so I tried to do what i thought was the right thing to do.
But in the end, I knew that the problem was actually me. You see, when you're a beginner, it's the hardest pill to swallow. Life is over.
Why do I suck? what am I going to do? Maybe the guitar is not right for me. I hear ya, it's goddamn crippling!

So what does a determined musician do when these type of things come up? Rise to the occassion, always.

In my case,
