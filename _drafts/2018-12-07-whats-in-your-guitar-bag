Say fella, what you got in the bag? 

When I was young, I always used to wonder what my favorite rock guitarists had in their bag. No, not just their gear bag, their 
actual travel <em>bag</em>. That does sound strange? It probably does but nevertheless, I used to obsess about what could be in their bags.
At first it was literally just obsessing about their gear bags but after getting into some articles, videos and whatever info I
could get my hands on, my obsession went further into their actual travel bags. After hearing all sorts of stories about rockstar 
antics, quirks, obessions, demands, things they can't live without or most important thing they carry while on tour, I started to 
look into my own gear bag and travel bag. 

I'm sure I'm not alone with this curiosity. 

So for years, I obsessed about guitarists gear bags, from famous rockstars to circuit players to regular ol' joe's. 

What pedals? Drugs? Alcohol? Extra strings and picks and how many? Sex toys? a harmonica? What!? What did
they carry with them? It was endless and I loved it. Hey, don't forget, there was no internet so videos and music was all I had.

These days, you can look it up.
