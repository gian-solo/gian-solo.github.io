Say fella, what you got in the bag? 

When I was young, I always used to wonder what my famous rock guitarists had in their bag. No, not just their gear bag, their 
bag, <em>bag</em>. That does sound strange? It probably does but nevertheless, I used to obsess about what could be in my famous 
guitar rock idol's bag. What pedals? Drugs? Alcohol? Extra strings and picks and how many? Sex toys? a harmonica? What!? What did
they carry with them? It was endless and I loved it. Hey, don't forget, there was no internet so videos and music was all I had.

These days, you can look it up.
