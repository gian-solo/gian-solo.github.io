Ever heard of Christian James Hand?

If you haven't, its okay, cause I barely heard about Christian last year after hearing "The Session" one morning while listening 
to the Frosty, Heidi & Frank show on 95.5 KLOS. I was running late for a business meeting that day and and the bluetooth in my 
truck stopped working that same morning. Awesome, not really, but what was awesome is the fact that I then turned the radio on
and heard an isolated drum track and instantly got curious as to why an isolated track was indeed playing on the radio? I was 
confused and bewildred. Am I actually listenig to the radio? Did I accidentally press the CD button and one of my old tracks 
played? What's going on?
 
Then I heard a voice go "Ooomphh, so good."

At this point, the conversation breaks out and even though I knew that I was listening to a radio show, I was still confused as
to what was actually happening. They started conversating about how good the drummer was, how amazing the bass parts were and 
how mind-blowing the whole track was but I was confused as I didn't hear the start of this conversation. I'm intrigued.
 
5 more minutes go by and I find myself quickly onboard with the track they were all referring to. It was "Born to Run" by Bruce
Springsteen. I finally heard the guitar track. I didn't think much of it afterwards as I was focused on the meeting I was about
to have but because I didn't fully get to listen to the whole conversation, I never quite forgot about the fact that they were  
breaking down the song, track-by-track. I have a certain affinity of hearing the real tracks from rock stars because without 
effects and whatnot, you get to hear the real talent behind the produced sound. Who doesn't want to hear that?
 
 But of course, time is valuable and as time went by, the whole thing slipped my mind.
 
 Months later,
