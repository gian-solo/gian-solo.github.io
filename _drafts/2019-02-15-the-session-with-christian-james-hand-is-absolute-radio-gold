Ever heard of Christian James Hand?

If you haven't, its okay, cause I barely heard about Christian last year after hearing "The Session" one morning while listening to Frosty,
 Heidi & Frank. I was running late for a business meeting that day and and the bluetooth in my truck stopped working that same morning. Awesome, 
 not really. But, what was awesome is the fact that once I turned the radio on, i heard a single drum track being played in a good chunk. I 
 was confused and bewildred. Am I actually listenig to the radio? Did I accidentally press the CD button and one of my old tracks was playing? 
 What's going on?
 
 Then I heard a voice go "Ooomphh, so good."
 
 At this point, the conversation breaks out and even though I knew that I was listening to a radio show, I was still confused as to what was
 actually happening. They started conversating about how good the drummer was, how amazing the bass parts were and how mind-blowing the whole
 track was but I again was confused as I didn't hear the start of this conversation. But I knew, my ears were completely loving it!
 
 10 more minutes go by and by now, I'm onboard as to which track they were all referring to. It was "Born to Run" by Bruce Springsteen.
 Of course I finally got it because at the exact point that I was getting out my ride, I heard the guitar track. I didn't think much of it 
 afterwards as I was focused on the meeting I was about to have but because I didn't fully get to listen to the whole conversation, I never
 quite forgot about the fact that they were breaking down the song, track-by-track. I have a certain affinity of hearing the real tracks from
 rock stars because without effects and whatnot, you get to hear the real talent behind the produced sound. Who doesn't want to hear that?
 
 But of course, time is valuable and as time went by, the whole thing slipped my mind.
 
 Months later,
