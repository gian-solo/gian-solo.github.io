The NAMM Show is well underway! The 2019 NAMM Show is currently located and being held at the Anaheim convention center in Anaheim, CA
and will run from January 24-27. For me, there's two parts to NAMM. Here's the first part.

What the hell is the NAMM show anyways? Well, my curious friend, here's a description, taken directly from their website:

"The NAMM Show is the definitive platform for the music, sound and event technology communities to unite, featuring more than 7,000 brands, cutting-edge industry education, as well as exclusive special events, concerts and experiences. Last year, a record 115K attendees explored products from more than 1,700 exhibitors 
showcasing over 7K brands. Plus, attendees are able to choose from 400+ educational sessions and more than 150+ networking events."

If that description wasn't enough to hook you in or pique your curiosity, add special live performances, amazing after parties and did I mention 
networking with people who matter in the industry? That's right, a who's who in the music industry will be in attendance and you will have
first perspective contact with some of the most important people in the music and tech industry. Literally, they all just walk freely around the convention 
because they know that it's mostly all industry folks. Dealers and Distributors will be doing actual work btw so try not to intrude or be rude for
that matter but if you really need to get a hold of someone, insert yourself and assert your intentions. It may go funny or it might be gold.

Which brings me to my next point, the NAMM show is not open to the public.

Yup, unfortunately, to get into this convention, you will either have to be an owner, supplier, employee, be an endorsed artist or is a guest of one of the 
NAMM member companies. 

What does this actually mean for the public or people that want to go? It's exactly what it means, its restricted with super tight security. Does
this mean you can't get in? Probably. But if you have friends in any NAMM member company, this is your best bet in getting a badge and getting in. NAMM
member companies get badges depending on the size of the company or how many employees they have. Don't 
know if your friends are part of the NAMM member company list? This can give you a good idea: <a href="https://www.namm.org/thenammshow/2019/directory">NAMM Show Directory</a>.
Now is the time to brush up with your friends and see who your real friends are. For more info on membership, <a href="https://www.namm.org/membership">go here.</a>

By the way, NAMM stands for National Association of Music Merchants. Don't be fooled by the acronym though, NAMM has evolved from a national retail association into a national association that includes 
commercial companies, distributors, affiliates and manufacturers. The NAMM show is basically that biggest trade-only event for music products, 
pro-audio and the event tech industry. It's truly a sight to see and an experience to be had!

The convention hours are 10am to 6pm, Thurs.-Sat. and 10am to 5pm on Sunday, the last day.

AND NOW.....the 2nd part of the NAMM Show, where I give you first-hand experiences and some info you really want to know.

You will walk. A LOT. 

Think about the Anaheim Convention Center. It's huge. Now think bout 1700 exhibitors promoting 7K brands. Add the walk from parking lots, to places to eat, 
to bars, the Marriott, the Hilton and other spots that line the convention center inside and out. Right, it's a lot and believe me, even just one day of walking 
is enough to question whether you want to see the next 3 days. I've gone from wearing boots the first year to wearing running shoes the last.

The after parties at the Mariott and the Hilton are top-notch.
