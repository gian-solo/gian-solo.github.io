Let's start off by saying, there are many answers. Matter of fact, there are way, way too many answers. One Google search pulls up hundreds of suggestions, forums, sites, products and whatnot, all adding to the confusion and your frustration. I mean, who the hell wants to ruin their guitar's fretboard right?

Well, my frustrated friend, I have an answer for you. You may not like it, you may not agree with it, and you might even think I'm wrong. That's all good. But I will tell you, I speak from the perspective of trying diferent oils throughout the years and seeing which ones were actually....safe to use on my precious babies. 

There are oils for different instances and then there are oils that you can specifically and safely use for the fretboard of your guitar. I can't even tell you how many oils we have on this planet. What I can tell you though, is that I've done my research, have gotten feedback from professional guitar players, applied different oils and gave them all equal time to see which one seemed to be the safest and actual best.

My criteria was simple: no residue, cleaned the fretboard and conditioned the wood.

If you're like me, I found out about oiling my fretboards after years of gigging with my Fender Strat. I noticed the fretboard had developed residue, lost its sheen and appeared to be acquiring hairline cracks. This is when my obsession with keeping the fretboard clean begun. I had a rocky beginning. The first oil that popped in my head was, baby oil.

Big mistake.
