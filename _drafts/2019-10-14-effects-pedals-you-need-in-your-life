<b>Heil Talk Box</b>

The original Heil Talk Box is unmatched. You can recreate the sounds of Peter Frampton, Joe Walsh, Slash, Alice In Chains, Aerosmith and many others. Can be set up with one guitar amp, but requires separate microphone and mic amplification. It's sturdy metal body, 6-1/2 feet of surgical tubing and a sturdy phenolic diaphragm is definitely an awesome feature.

The VCR is Ryan Adams signature Volume/Chorus/Reverb pedal inspired by the tones of The Cure, The Smiths and a hefty dose of 1980's angst. Although I'm a huge fan of the <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=yFSmrAC1uMU&offerid=490021.10315139422&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samash.com%2Fboss-ch-1-super-chorus-guitar-effects-pedal-rch1%3Fcm_mmc%3DLinkShare-_-Amplifiers%2520%2F%2520Effects-_-Channeladvisor-_-Boss%2BCH-1%2BSuper%2BChorus%2BPedal%26utm_source%3DLKS%26utm_medium%3DCSE%26utm_campaign%3DChanneladvisor" rel="nofollow">Boss CH-1 Super Chorus Pedal</a><IMG border=0 width=1 height=1 src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=yFSmrAC1uMU&bids=490021.10315139422&type=2&subid=0" > and is what I use on the daily, the JHS Pedlas VCR is something to pull out for impressing folks. It's tone is super delicious!

This special edition of the the Carbon Copy Analog Delay features a lightweight aluminum housing with a metallic silver finish to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the world's bestselling analog delay pedal. It's not the 10th anniversary for no reason, it's simply one of the best. 

<b>MXR Phase 90</b>

Provides the classic four stage phasing sound with continuous variable speed control. Phase 90 fixed regeneration level adds intensity and is particularly effective for keyboards. This device has found its way into many of Eddie Van Halen's recordings, adding a shimmery velocity to lead passages or a more dramatic swoosh to muted strumming. This phaser is not just designed for guitars; it works well with bass, keyboards and even vocals and appears in all of these guises on Dweezil Zappa's Z album, 'Music For Pets', which hints it is flexible and hip.

After going through quite a few loop-based guitar effects pedals, I finally found one that fits my needs for studio to live applications. I found the JamMan. After inventing looping nearly three decades ago, DigiTech's JamMan Solo XT still brings the definitive stereo looping experience. It's simply the best loop pedal I've messed with, hands down.

<b>MXR Smart Gate</b>
<a target='new' href="https://click.linksynergy.com/link?id=yFSmrAC1uMU&offerid=490021.7045641344&type=2&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samash.com%2Fmxr-m135-smart-gate-guitar-effects-pedal-mm135xxxx%3Fcm_mmc%3DLinkShare-_-Amplifiers%2520%2F%2520Effects-_-Channeladvisor-_-MXR%2BM135%2BSmart%2BGate%2BPedal%26utm_source%3DLKS%26utm_medium%3DCSE%26utm_campaign%3DChanneladvisor" rel="nofollow"><IMG border=0 src="https://images.samash.com/sa/MM1/MM135XXXX-P.fpx?cell=500%2C500&cvt=jpg" ></a><IMG border=0 width=1 height=1 src="https://ad.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/show?id=yFSmrAC1uMU&bids=490021.7045641344&type=2&subid=0" >
If you're addicted to the indispensable juice of a high gain amp or a string of stomp boxes, you need this pedal. It's my favorite noise killer. Equipped with three selectable types of noise reduction, Hiss, Mid, and Full, the Smart Gate bites down on sizzle and hum but lets the smallest detail of your playing through. With its uncanny ability to sense precisely when -and how fast -to engage, this little genius will never get in your way, so you can wring every last bit of sustain out of that chord without being cut off. Open or closed, it adds virtually nothing to your signal. MXR has also squeezed this baby down from half space rack size to a slender stomp box, leaving plenty of room underfoot for your newly tamed effects.

Like the legendary Big Muff Pi of the 70's, the reissue has three controls that let the player dial in the finest harmonic distortion/sustain ever produced. The Volume control adjusts the output level. The Sustain control optimizes the long sustain with just the right amount of harmonic distortion. The Tone control provides a range of sounds, from warm bass to crisp treble. Let distortion ring!
