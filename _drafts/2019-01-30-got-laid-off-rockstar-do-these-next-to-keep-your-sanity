And that day finally came. The day that you thought would never come but now it's here, in your face and it's totally happening.
It's unsettling, it's giving you anxiety, it's completely overwhelming, it's...life is over.

The day that I speak of is the day you get laid-off or fired from work.

I remember the first time I was laid-off. I didn't understand, couldn't wrap my head around it and all just seemed like a complete 
diss or disrespect to the work that I did for the company. I felt betrayed, lost and started to forward think everything to it's worst 
scenario and increasingly became frustrated, angry and sad, all at the same time. It felt like being stomped by the universe, making you
feel worthless. How was I to pay the bills? Do I have to move back in with mom? It sucks to the point of tears.

But what I found out after a few days was, everything was going to be okay.

I was young, completely naive and didn't understand the business model and why it runs the way it does. Fast forward to a few jobs later 
and running my own company, I'm now completely woke and versed in the ways of running a successful business. Unfortunately, lay-offs
are sometimes a necessary evil in order for a company to restructure, restrategize or re-envision the dream. 

But I digress, as I know, getting let go from a job, never, ever feels good. It feels shitty and that's saying it nicely.

But instead of crawling yourself into a bottle, crying because all feels lost or thinking that life is not worth living, do these 5 things 
instead and get back into focus and get back in the game.

<b>Take.A.Deep.Breath</b>
<b>That Was Not Your Dream Job</b>
<b>Reach Out and Network</b>
<b>It's a Blessing In Disguise, Time to Try Out Your Ideas</b>
<b>Process Your Feelings and Re-Start</b>

Other things to remember?
- Get stuff off your computer
- Get full details from HR
- It's business and it's unforgiving
