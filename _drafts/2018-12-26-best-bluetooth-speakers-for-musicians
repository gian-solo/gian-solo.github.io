In the market for a badass bluetooth speaker for your listening needs? Let me help. I've chosen 5 that are sure to satisfy your listening needs. Whether you dable
in rock, rap, hip-hop, classical, jazz, folk, metal, dance, electronic or whichever music you prefer, these 5 are it.
After assessing their pros and cons, I came to a concensus and chose the winners based on a few factors.

Now you're probably wondering why I'm not talking about smart speakers in the year 2019? Well, after playing with smart speakers,
i got tired of a few things, such as playing the wrong song from a certain artist because of the same song titles from another artist, 
Wi-Fi connectivity issues and battery life. I love smart speakers but those few things irk me quite a bit...especially when you're lost
in a moment listening to a song and then the song cuts because of an airplane passing by. Sucks!

So, if you're a music lover like me, the cutting of sound is the sound of bummer to completely annoying, in varying degrees. Hence, why
why I'm rallying for bluetooth speakers and not smart speakers. Besides, that's really a whole story in itself so for now, let's
fill our musical souls craving for a worthy bluetooth speaker that can push the experience past the speakers. 

Here are the factors I considered:

- Audio quality 
- Connectivity
- Battery life
- Speaker grit
- Charging features 
- Wireless range

<b>Bose SoundLink Color II</b>

Need speakers that compliment the color of your sound? This one's for you. Classic Bose greatness packed in a gorgeous color case
that screams awesome. I'm in love with these!

<b>JBL Flip 4</b>
<p align="right"><img src=""></p>
Boom! That was my first impression of this little waterproof beast. Made by one of the most trusted brands in audio, JBL, the 
Flip 4 is truly magnificent in sound, design and durability. It's great as a go-to, the price is unreal and the roar is huge.

<b>Sony XB31</b>
<p align="right"><img src=""></p>
Funny story about this one. My dad found one in a golf cart that someone had left behind and never came back for. My dad brought it
over to help get set up and right there and then, we started comparing it to the others and to my surprise, because it never came
across my radar before, it delivered! It had the Sony sound down pat and held it's own right next to the others, holding down 
the same factors as well such as waterproof, bass and clarity.

<b>UE Boom 2</b>
<p align="right"><img src="https://www.ultimateears.com/content/dam/ue-components/temp-gallery/boom2-phantom-2.png.imgw.1200.1200.jpg"></p>Probably one of the most recognized in this category and rightfully so. It sounds freakin' ace all the time! Boasting the same crispiness of Bose
systems but with a bit more bottom end focus makes the UE Boom hard not to buy. It's also definitely designed with travelers in mind so if you
travel quite a bit, put this one into consideration.

<b>Marshall Kilburn II</b>
<p align="right"><img src="https://www.marshallheadphones.com/media/resized/catalog/product/c/a/cart-kilburn-ii-900x900_1_900.png"></p>
Are you freakin' kidding me? Look at that thing. It's GORGEOUS! As a musician, the design on this one is completely flawless and ultra
attractive. The speakers also boasts a sweetened sound that's fit for more rock oriented music rather than hip-hop, dance or other
bass heavy songs so keep that in mind while comparing these to the others. Don't get me wrong, it holds it's own but when you crank
classic rock through them, it sounds immaculate. I'm just sayin'!

<b>Bose Soundlink Revolve</b>
<p align="right"><img src=""></p>
If I had to choose one from this list, it's this one. I don't know what they do in their labs or who is the master of ears, the Bose
Revolve puts your ears through an experience with each note. Deeper bass, clearer highs and an overall killer depth of sound makes
this one my personal choice. You can close your eyes and feel the music through these.

<b>Bang & Olufsen Play</b>
<p align="right"><img src=""></p>
Incredibly crystal clear. Music sounded warm, bright and silky. Along with a great design, the features are also pretty killer 
and size is completely right. This one's an easy decision, but to each their own.

<b>Sonos Beam</b>
<p align="right"><img src=""></p>
Sonos makes amazing audio products and the Sonos Beam is def. one of their best. the price tag is a bit on the higher end but as
the saying goes, you get what you pay for and you will definitely get what you pay for with the Sonos Beam. It gives incredibly full-
bodied sound and incomparable sound-listening experience. If you're a music director, look no further.
