In the market for a badass bluetooth speaker? Let me help. I've chosen 5 that are sure to satisfy your music needs. Whether you'll
be listening to rock, rap, hip-hop, classical, jazz, folk, metal, dance, electronic or whichever music you prefer, these 5 are it.
I ran them through a few different set of tests to see where each one stood and after assessing their pros and cons, the answer 
couldn't be clearer.

Now you're probably wondering why I'm not talking about smart speakers in the year 2019? Well, after playing with smart speakers,
i got tired of a few things, such as playing the wrong song from a certain artist because of the same song titles from another artist, 
Wi-Fi connectivity issues and battery life. I love smart speakers but those few things irk me quite a bit...especially when you're lost
in a moment listening to a song and then the song cuts because of an airplane passing by. Sucks!

So, if you're a musician like me, the cutting of sound is the sound of varying degrees of bummer to completely annoying. Hence, why
why I'm rallying for bluetooth speakers and not smart speakers. Besides, that's really a whole story in itself so for now, let's
fill our musical souls craving for a worthy bluetooth speaker that can push the experience past the speakers.

<b>Bose SoundLink Color II</b>
Need speakers that compliment the color of your sound? This one's for you. Classic Bose greatness packed in a gorgeous color case
that screams awesome. I'm in love with these!

<b>JBL Flip 4</b>
Boom! That was my first impression of this little waterproof beast. Made by one of the most trusted brands in audio, JBL, the 
Flip 4 is truly magnificent in sound, design and durability. It's great as a go-to, the price is unreal and the roar is huge.

<b>Sony XB31</b>
Funny story about this one. My dad found one in a golf cart that someone had left behind and never came back for. My dad brought it
over to help get set up and right there and then, we started comparing it to the others and to my surprise, because it never came
across my radar before, it delivered! It had the Sony sound down pat and held it's own right next to the others, holding down 
the same factors as well such as waterproof, bass and clarity.

<b>UE Boom 2</b>
Probably one of the most recognized in this category and rightfully so. It sounds freakin' ace all the time! Boasting the same crispiness of Bose
systems but with a bit more bottom end focus makes the UE Boom hard not to buy. It's also definitely designed with travelers in mind so if you
travel quite a bit, put this one into consideration.

<b>Marshall Kilburn II</b>
Are you freakin' kidding me? Look at that thing. It's GORGEOUS! As a musician, the design on this one is completely flawless and ultra
attractive. The speakers also boasts a sweetened sound that's fit for more rock oriented music rather than hip-hop, dance or other
bass heavy songs so keep that in mind while comparing these to the others. Don't get me wrong, it holds it's own but when you crank
classic rock through them, it sounds immaculate. I'm just sayin'!
