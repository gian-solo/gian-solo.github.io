The holidays are upon us and so are holiday gigs! 

Musicians are particularly busy during the holidays as holiday events are held throughout different countries and cities 
during the months of November through December and most events will require some form of entertainment. Live music becomes a

there's nothing like awesome live music to help make an event go from subpar to spectacular.
