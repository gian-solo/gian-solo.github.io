The holidays are upon us and so are holiday gigs! 

Musicians are particularly busy during the holidays as holiday events are held throughout different countries and cities 
during the months of November through December and most events will require some form of entertainment. Live music becomes a
go-to of sorts during the holidays as live music pretty much goes hand-in-hand with other forms of entertainment. Really though, 
there's nothing like awesome live music to help make an event go from subpar to spectacular. 

What people don't realize though is that musicians don't really play holiday music throughout the year. I mean, of course they 
wouldn't be but it doesn't hurt to clarify. For further clarification, we do not play holiday music at all throughout the year
because there's really no sense in memorizing songs that you will play only probably once in December. I could totally be wrong 
about this but in my twenty-something years of gigging, this has been the case, all around.

So, because of this, I'd like to help out my fellow guitarists, especially beginners, in trying their hand at some holiday songs
to hopefully be ready for the holiday or if they're asked to perform. I chose these three based on ease of play, chord/notes 
familiarity and song popularity. Basically, these songs are known and easy to pick and strum.
