There are many bands that I love and then there is Tool. I've long separated the band from other bands as Tool is undoubtedly in
a league of their own, especially after releasing another mind-blowing record in Fear Inoculum. Be it that you may not agree or may
not care about where Tool is in the spectrum of great musicians and bands but I do care and will tell you that they are at the top.
Simply put, there is no other band on this planet that can come close to creating musical pieces like Tool that gives listeners a musical
experience that reverberates years and years after. It may take them years to create records but with one listen, you'll understand why.

I managed to get in and see a little of Killing Joke. Having never heard anything from this band, except for their actual name,
I knew nothing of their catalog. So a few songs in, I exited stage left to get beer, jaded LA concert-goer style. Their sound was 
mucked to the point that I couldn't tell any instrument and it just sounded like one big roar, mostly discernible. I wanted it to be
good but no quarter.

Basically, half the crowd left for the concessions stands halfway through Killing Joke's set. 

After about 30 mins, the stage was finally set for Tool.

Armed with a huge sound, amazing visuals and a fair warning not to record video or shoot a photo, Tool hit the stage and things got
underway
