Father's Day is right around the corner and dad probably deserves something awesome am I right?

Problem is, dad's a rocker. Dad lives for rock n' roll, guitars and music. Does this sound
like your dad? My dad is not a rocker dad but I am. Let me tell you, nothing makes me happier than music and guitars. In a perfect
world, it would be as such.

I've compiled a list of items below that I think rocker dad's would like. It is Father's day so some of the things maybe a bit of 
a splurge but if you got some of that sweet extra cash lyin' round,' then I suppose it wouldn't hurt so much? I could totally be wrong.
Some of the items are definitely fairly priced but again, this is a list for rocker dads, so it's going to be a bit different from your 
usual Father's day gift list. 

I've searched far and wide as I can and I think you'll enjoy some of the finds I've made.
