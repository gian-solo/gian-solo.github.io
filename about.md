For the Love of Guitars is a space where I contribute my adoration and knowledge for the guitar and all things music by sharing valuable information, tips, advice, thoughts and guidance through articles, features, news, personal stories, videos and other media. I’m thrilled to know that the value of my expert contributions will have a positive impact in the world of guitars and music. For the Love of Guitars was made for guitar players, music lovers, future rock stars and guitar fans worldwide. 

Over the years, I’ve built my reputation as an expert in music, arts and lifestyle trends. I provide great care in the work that I do to help my patrons navigate through music information, unique arts and help curate their lifestyle. I am 100% original and uphold my style, work quality and statement. I choose to work with investors, creators, companies, artists, brands, songwriters, bands, musicians, entrepreneurs, labels, consumers, buyers, visionaries, collaborators, customers and others that pursue the same coaction vision of quality, value, and substance.
